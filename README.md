# Speed-Typing-Test-in-Python
In this code, the calculate_typing_speed function calculates the typing speed in words per minute. It takes the start time, end time, and the typed text as input. It calculates the total time taken, the number of words typed, and then computes the typing speed using the formula: (words_typed / total_time) * 60.

The run_speed_typing_test function is responsible for running the actual typing test. It sets the desired text to type, prompts the user to start typing, and starts the timer when the user presses Enter. The user can then type the given text and press Enter again when finished.

After the user completes typing, the end time is recorded, and the typing speed is calculated by calling the calculate_typing_speed function. Finally, the typing speed is printed to the console.
